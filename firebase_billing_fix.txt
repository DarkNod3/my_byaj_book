HOW TO FIX THE "BILLING_NOT_ENABLED" ERROR

The error "Verification failed: An internal error has occurred. [BILLING_NOT_ENABLED]" occurs because Firebase requires a billing account to be set up for Phone Authentication, even if you remain within the free tier limits. This is to prevent abuse of the SMS verification service.

Follow these steps to enable billing:

1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project (my-byaj-book)
3. Click on the "Upgrade" button in the left sidebar
4. Choose a billing plan (Blaze Pay-as-you-go is recommended)
5. Complete the billing setup by adding a credit/debit card

Additional verification steps:
1. After enabling billing, go to "Authentication" in the Firebase Console
2. Go to the "Sign-in method" tab
3. Make sure "Phone" is enabled as a sign-in provider
4. Click on "Phone" and verify that it shows as "Enabled"

Note: Firebase offers a generous free tier for Phone Authentication:
- 10,000 free phone verifications per month
- You will only be charged if you exceed this limit

After enabling billing, restart your app and try the phone verification again.

IMPORTANT: If you're using a test phone number that you previously configured in the Firebase Console, make sure it's correctly set up in the "Phone numbers for testing" section in the "Authentication" > "Sign-in method" tab.
