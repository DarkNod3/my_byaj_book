INSTRUCTIONS TO FIX THE FIREBASE PROJECT NAME

The OTP verification messages currently show "exam-lover.firebaseapp.com" instead of "My Byaj Book" because the Firebase project's public-facing name needs to be updated.

Follow these steps:

1. Open the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your "exam-lover" project
3. Click on the gear icon (⚙️) next to "Project Overview" to access "Project settings"
4. Under "Project settings", you'll see two name fields:
   - "Project name" (visible only to project members)
   - "Public-facing name" (this is what appears in SMS messages)
5. Click the edit (pencil) icon next to "Public-facing name"
6. Change it to "My Byaj Book"
7. Click "Save"

8. IMPORTANT: Verify that your app is registered with the correct package name:
   - In Project Settings > Your Apps section, check that "com.rjinnovativemedia.mybyajbook" is registered
   - If not, add your Android app using this package name
   - Download the google-services.json file and place it in android/app/

This change will ensure all future SMS verification messages show "My Byaj Book" instead of "exam-lover.firebaseapp.com".

ADDITIONAL STEPS:

1. We've already added necessary metadata tags in your AndroidManifest.xml file
2. We've also applied Firebase App Check for additional security
3. Updated Firebase configuration in main.dart to use the correct package name
4. After updating the project name in Firebase Console, rebuild and run your app:
   
   ```
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter run
   ```

NOTE: It may take a few minutes for the changes to propagate through Firebase's systems.
